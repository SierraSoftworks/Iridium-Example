# Iridium Example
This is a small example project which shows how one would go about
starting out with Iridium. It is by no means a full showcase of
Iridium's functionality, but if you're struggling with the first
stages then it may help you out.

## Components

### Models
The models folder includes the various database models, these are
registered within the `Database.ts` file for ease of use, but you
can also use them separately if you wish.

### Typings
The typings folder includes various DefinitelyTyped definitions,
they aren't strictly necessary but may resolve some compiler issues
and are definitely useful to have lying around.
